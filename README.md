# IoT Based Water Management System
Water resource information on-line monitoring is basic and important to water resource management. An IoT based water management system that measures water level in real -time is proposed in this work. The prototype is based on to automate the process of managing water in overhead tank. The system will inform the user about water level in the overhead tank as well as it will start the motor when the tank is empty. The motor will not start if the water level is low in ground water tank. The water utilized will be stored in a database and the monthly requirement of water as well as yearly and weekly requirement will be displayed in a graphical way. The whole system is connected through WIFI to the internet. The communication between motor and the water sensor takes place through WIFI. The user will be able to track the real time running of the system as well as to control the system. This system enables better water management thereby reducing water wastage.
