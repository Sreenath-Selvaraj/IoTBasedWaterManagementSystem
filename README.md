# IoT Based Water Management System
An IoT based water management system that measures the water level in real-time. The prototype is to automate the process of managing water in the overhead tank. The system will inform the user about the water level in the overhead tank as well as it will start the motor when the tank is empty. The motor will not start if the water level is low in the groundwater tank. The water utilized will be stored in a database and the monthly requirement of water, as well as yearly and weekly requirements, will be displayed graphically. The whole system is connected through WIFI to the internet. The communication between the motor and the water sensor takes place through WIFI. The user will be able to track the real-time running of the system as well as to control the system. This system enables better water management thereby reducing water wastage.
